# üêç Wireshark Network Traffic Analysis

**Analysis Performed By:** Manoj Mandal  
**Date:** 2025-06-26  
**Capture File:** [`wireshark_capture.pcapng`](./wireshark_capture.pcapng)  
**Tool Used:** [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/)  

---

## üéØ Objective

To analyze captured network traffic for patterns, protocol usage, and potential anomalies using **Wireshark**. This includes HTTP requests, OCSP checks, and IPv6 traffic to understand the behavior of the host during the session.

---

## üóÇÔ∏è Key Observations

### üîπ HTTP Traffic
- **GET Requests**:
  - `/success.txt?ipv4` ‚Üí `34.107.221.82` (Returned HTTP 200 OK)
  - `/success.txt?ipv6` ‚Üí `2600:1901:0:38d7::` (Returned HTTP 302 Redirect)
  - `/favicon.ico` ‚Üí Returned HTTP 404 (Not Found)
- **Status Codes Observed**:
  - `200 OK`, `302 Redirect`, `304 Not Modified`, `404 Not Found`

---

### üîπ OCSP (Online Certificate Status Protocol)
- Multiple OCSP requests made to:
  - `23.58.120.18`
  - `23.10.239.251`
  - `2606:4700:8392:c460:...`
- OCSP responses were successful (mostly 938‚Äì1374 bytes)

---

### üîπ IPv6 Traffic
- Active communication between:
  - `2401:4900:8829:...` ‚Üî `2600:1901:...`
  - `2401:4900:8829:...` ‚Üî `2606:4700:8392:...`

| 885       | 44.0615    | 2600:1406:...       | 2401:4900:...       | HTTP     | 304 Not Modified             |
| 891       | 44.8299    | 2600:1406:...       | 2401:4900:...       | HTTP     | 404 Not Found (favicon.ico)  |

## üîê Security Insight

- **OCSP Checks** indicate SSL/TLS certificate validation ‚Äî common in secure HTTPS connections.
- **Presence of IPv6 Traffic** confirms dual-stack networking (IPv4 and IPv6).
- **404 Errors** on `/favicon.ico` could indicate incomplete web server configurations.

---

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

This network capture reveals:
- Active web communication via IPv4 and IPv6.
- Routine OCSP checks ensuring certificate validity.
- Successful and failed HTTP responses that help profile network behavior.
